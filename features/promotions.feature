Feature: The promotion service back-end
    As a Store Owner
    I need a RESTful catalog service
    So that I can keep track of all my promotions

Background:
    Given the following promotions
        | name       | description          | promo_code        | start_date                | end_date             | is_active |
        | deal       | buy one get one free | b1g1free          | 2021-04-01 12:00:00       | 2021-05-01 12:00:00  | true      |
        | sale       | discount price       | offprice          | 2021-04-01 12:00:00       | 2021-05-01 12:00:00  | true      |
        | free       | free item            | free              | 2021-04-01 12:00:00       | 2021-05-01 12:00:00  | true      |
